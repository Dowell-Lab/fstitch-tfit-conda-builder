  description: |
    Transcription fit (or Tfit) implements a finite mixture model to
    identify signatures of RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) activity through
    the identification of bidirectional or divergent transcription in
    nascent transcription assays such as Global Run-On (GRO) and
    Precision Run-on (PRO) followed by sequencing data.
